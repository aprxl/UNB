## Software Development (Desenvolvimento de Software)

### Description

This folder contains most of the work I did at my DS classes. That is, all the code I wrote when doing our exercises and exams.

### Thoughts

This was surely one of the most fun subjects I've had within my time at UNB. That's mostly due to how things worked:
instead of having multiple exams that were boring both to study to and take, you only had a single final project and,
throughout our entire semester, all we had to do was think of a cool idea, develop it and deploy the final product.
Well, that's easier said than done.

At first we had to form groups, which was essentially done randomly, meaning I got to meet quite a lot of people.
Then we had to come up with an idea and code it. After some debates - and arguements - we settled on the idea
of making a multiplayer web-browser turn-based card game using only Javascript and HTML.

After discussing our ideas and picking what would be good and/or fun, we started developing the game. And that's
where all our issues began. Our group was initially composed by eight members, but within the first two weeks of
development, two of them left, leaving us with only six members. Then we had some complications between some of our
classmates and it resulted in more people leaving the group, including our captain - a veteran that was supposed
to guide us throughout the semester. That had a huge impact on our progress and we took a while to recover from it.

As we slowly regained our confidence, we resumed our development of the game at a pretty nice pace, but we still had a
problem: most of our group's members didn't know anything about web development or just app development in general,
meaning that most them couldn't directly contribute coding itself. In the end, there were only three developers,
one of them being me who worked strictly on the backend. 

Fortunately, the ones that weren't great programmers were great in other areas, meaning that our game received some great
artwork done, a really nice and coherent backstory and overall a really polished design for our website. So, 
ultimately, everyone contributed in the way they could.

In the end, we didn't really reach our expectations as we didn't have enough time considering we had other
eight subjects to worry about, which left us with an unfinished product. However, this didn't
stop us from being proud of our work. We had a working website which contained our homepage, the barebones
page where our game would be played and a socket-based chat. It's nothing too fancy, but still it was probably
one of the coolest applications developed by our class, because it was the only app that was actually deployed
and anyone could use. Yes, that means that we had more than 25 users connect to a single chat and spam it with
random stuff, which was quite fun.
