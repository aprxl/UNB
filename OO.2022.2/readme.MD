# OO

## Object-Oriented Programming (Orientação a Objetos)

### Description

This folder contains most of the work I did at my OO/OOP classes. That is, all the code I wrote when doing our exercises and exams.

### Thoughts

This subject was by far the most frustrating one I've had so far. 

At the beginning of the semester, I felt like it was going to be a smooth sailing all semester long because 
I'm very familiar with C++ code and Object Oriented Programming and, indeed, I didn't get to 
learn a lot of new stuff. However, what got me frustrated was the fact that, despite of having the knowledge,
I would still score very poorly in almost every single one of my exams, and I couldn't figure out why.

At first I felt like I was using features that were too modern and the teacher couldn't really understand - which
was a fair assumption considering the teacher's examples were written in C99 and the book used was pretty old as
well. But I figured that wasn't the case, because even when writing code as simple as I could, I still would score
poorly, despite knowing that what I wrote was correct.

Later on, I constantly felt like the teacher didn't fully understand the stuff being taught in class since he would
often make simple mistakes and make false statements, and when he was contested by a student saying he was wrong
or that the code he was writing wouldn't compile correctly etc, he would essentially ignore the comment and move
on, which was very upsetting to me.

After doing some digging and talking to other teachers, I found out that my OOP teacher indeed wasn't qualified
to be teaching that subject, however, the university didn't really have anyone else to lecture those classes. That
immediately made change my mind about him, as I realized he didn't want to be there, but he didn't really have a choice.
So instead of being upset on him and just giving up, I tried contacting and explaining my situation to him.

To my surprise, he was very considerate and he turned out to be a pretty chill dude. He understood my frustation
and helped me get my grades back up, which ultimately lead me to pass. This did essentially teach me to not give up
and try even if the odds are bad.
