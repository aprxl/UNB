# APC

## Computer Algorithms and Programming

### Description

This folder contains most of the work I did at my APC classes. That is, all the code I wrote when doing our exercises and exams.
Most of this code isn't the most optimized or fancy C code you'll ever see, but that's because I used my source files as examples
to help my friends and other classmates (more about that below). And no, this is definitely not an excuse!

Note that there are some random files I used for testing stuff scattered around as well. I will clean it up eventually (never).

### My thoughts (and emotional mumbling)

At our classes, we were taught the basics of programming syntax and logic. However, I noticed that it'd be a
waste of time if I just sat there and pretended to be learning anything new since I already had some knowledge about coding
in general due to my years of experience with several different programming languages. Having said so, at the end of our first class,
I immediatelly spoke to our teacher, at the time, and asked if instead of just sitting through all of the classes, I could actually
help the other students at our labs, and he gladly said yes. I figured this would be the best way for me to learn something new and be useful
at the same time. And thats essentially how my life as an university student began.

On my first day working, unofficially, as a tutor, I noticed how painfully naive I was. Our programming language of choice was C,
which I didn't think would be a problem since I had quite a bit of experience with C++ prior to that. However, having to help people with
their problems and, more importantly, explain to them how they're wrong and assist them with visualizing very abstract concepts proved to
be a much bigger challenge than I had previously antecipated. But that didn't demotivate me, quite the opposite, it only made me more eager
to help them. I became quite fond of teaching people and watching their faces as they finally understood a concept they hadn't grasped just yet.
Not only was it satisfying to me, but it also was pretty rewarding.

I'm glad to say that, by helping others learn, I've learned a lot myself. Not only about C/C++ programming, but also about teaching and talking
to different people. I also learned a lot of new stuff, such as [MANIM](https://github.com/3b1b/manim), an animation engine made in Python which
I used to make a few explainer videos. At the same time I was learning, I also met a lot of different people, some of which I personally
consider to be close friends of mine. And, overall, this all contributed to me having the best time I've had in years.

I've had some people ask me why I am doing this if I'm not being paid for it or receiving any extra credits, and to that I say: it was never
about the gains, but about the rewards. What I've achieved so far is priceless to me and I wouldn't give away this feeling for anything else.
Like, of course, getting paid do to this work is nice and all, my new mechanical keyboard isn't gonna pay for itself, and I do plan on applying
to be a real tutor, but I'll still gladly do what I'm doing even if I didn't get any recognition for it.

Now that's enough of me being all dramatic, let's wrap this thing up. In general, I'm glad with what I've experienced so far and I'm pretty
happy to be finally studying the stuff I wanted to, unlike 90% of what I was taught at highschool. I can't wait to see what's next!

Our first semester just ended and, even though I'm tired, I still enjoyed every single moment of it. I'm also glad that me
and most of my colleagues were able to finish this semester with very decent grades, except on Calculus, we're
quite beat up by the "punch in the face" that were our classes. I dislike the fact that our teacher's funny
and chill, it's like I can't even properly hate the guy.
